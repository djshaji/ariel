# LV2 Worker Schedule Feature Implementation

## Overview

The LV2 Worker Schedule feature (`http://lv2plug.in/ns/ext/worker#schedule`) enables plugins to schedule work in a separate thread, crucial for non-real-time operations like file I/O, complex computations, or state changes that cannot be performed in the audio callback.

## Implementation

### Core Components

1. **ArielWorkerSchedule Structure**
   ```c
   typedef struct {
       GThreadPool *thread_pool;     // Thread pool for work execution
       GMutex work_mutex;           // Mutex for thread safety
       GQueue *work_queue;          // Queue for pending work items
       ArielActivePlugin *plugin;   // Associated plugin reference
   } ArielWorkerSchedule;
   ```

2. **Worker Thread Pool**
   - Uses GLib's GThreadPool with 2 worker threads
   - Manages work items asynchronously
   - Thread-safe queue management

3. **LV2 Worker Interface**
   - Implements `LV2_Worker_Schedule` interface
   - Provides `schedule_work` function for plugins
   - Handles work item scheduling and response

### Key Functions

- **`ariel_worker_schedule_new()`**: Creates worker schedule with thread pool
- **`ariel_worker_schedule()`**: LV2 interface function for scheduling work
- **`ariel_worker_respond()`**: Handles work completion responses
- **`ariel_worker_thread_func()`**: Worker thread execution function

### Integration Points

1. **Plugin Manager Initialization**
   ```c
   manager->worker_schedule = ariel_worker_schedule_new();
   ```

2. **LV2 Features Creation**
   ```c
   LV2_Worker_Schedule *schedule = g_malloc0(sizeof(LV2_Worker_Schedule));
   schedule->handle = manager->worker_schedule;
   schedule->schedule_work = ariel_worker_schedule;
   
   features[5]->URI = LV2_WORKER__schedule;
   features[5]->data = schedule;
   ```

3. **Plugin Association**
   - Worker schedule gets plugin reference when plugin is loaded
   - Enables work responses to be routed back to correct plugin

## Usage by Plugins

Plugins that require the worker schedule feature include:
- **ZynAddSubFX**: Complex synthesis that needs worker threads
- **gx_amp**: Amplifier modeling with file loading capabilities
- **File-based plugins**: Any plugin that loads samples, models, or presets

## Benefits

1. **Real-time Safety**: Keeps audio callback thread free from blocking operations
2. **File I/O Support**: Enables plugins to load files asynchronously
3. **Complex Processing**: Allows heavy computations in background threads
4. **State Management**: Supports plugins that need to manage complex state changes

## Implementation Status

âœ… **Completed Features:**
- Thread pool creation and management
- Work item scheduling interface
- Plugin association system
- Memory management and cleanup
- Integration with existing LV2 feature system

âœ… **Verified Working:**
- Worker schedule created successfully on startup
- LV2 features include worker schedule in feature list
- Thread pool initialized with proper configuration
- Compatible with existing plugin loading system

## Future Enhancements

ðŸ”„ **Potential Improvements:**
- Plugin-specific worker thread pools
- Work priority queuing system
- Performance monitoring and statistics
- Advanced error handling and recovery
- Integration with plugin UI updates

## Test Results

The implementation successfully:
- Creates worker schedule on plugin manager initialization
- Includes worker schedule in LV2 features array
- Provides proper interface for plugins requiring worker threads
- Maintains compatibility with existing codebase
- Integrates seamlessly with URID mapping and other LV2 features

**Log Output Confirmation:**
```
Created LV2 worker schedule with thread pool
Created LV2 features: URID Map/Unmap, Options, State Make Path, Map Path, Worker Schedule
```

This implementation provides the foundation for LV2 plugins that require non-real-time worker thread functionality.
