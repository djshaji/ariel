Create a simple ncurses-based command-line interface (CLI) application in C that displays a menu with options to view, add, and delete pluginsfrom a list. The application should handle user input and update the display accordingly.

UI Controls:
- Do not touch existing code
- The same layout as GTK4 UI
- Plugin list on the left
- Active plugin controls on the right
- In the active plugins list, show plugin name and status (active/inactive)
- In the active plugin controls, show options to activate/deactivate the selected plugin
- Press 'a' to add a plugin, 'd' to delete a selected plugin, and 'q' to quit the application.
